Problems
--------

- Many people working on the same thing. Not necessarily in the same place, but possibly at the same time.
- Want to delete something but not lose it
- Not sure where the other gal made a change
- Wouldn't it be cool if you could see how the thing evolved?

- nothing lost (don't need a bunch of backup copies)
- associating changes with their authors

- edits to someone else's work
