dusty sucks

Introductions

Talk about the problem of writing and editing in groups, prompt crowd for questions

Talk about other features we want in our writing and editing software
- multiple actors working on the same stuff
- change history
- nothing lost (don't need a bunch of backup copies)
- associating changes with their authors

These are very similar problems to what writers reporters deal with, at a different scale
Writing an application is like writing a big book. But if you mess up any spelling or grammar, the book won't print. Editors and readers may be forgiving, but computers are not. 

Examples of software that solves some of the problems

Talk about more problems that developers have, especially in open source. The genesis of git && the development of Linux. (distributed source control)

Talk about git, features, goals

(aside) talk about text files

Github is git, but git is not github
Github is to git as Facebook is to jpeg photos

So...
Let's use github for something useful...
Prose.io!
